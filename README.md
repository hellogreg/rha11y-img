# rha11y-tools bookmarklets

This project is branded to **RHa11y**, Red Hat's accessibility volunteer group.

## Overview

These bookmarklets form a collection of unitaskers originally designed to help automate page QA testing processes at Red Hat.

The collection currently comprises the following tools:

- **rha11y-img-checker:** tests the accessibility of all page images
- **rha11y-img-hide:** hides all images on a page
- **rha11y-img-filesize:** ensures images aren't too large
- **rha11y-heading-h1:** lists a page's &lt;h1&gt; elements
- **rha11y-link-target:** ensures links don't target new windows
- **rha11y-form-labels:** checks all form inputs for associated/enclosing labels
